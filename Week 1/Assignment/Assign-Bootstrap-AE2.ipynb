    "- Only use the paired bootstrap\n",
    "- Work with Numpy vectors or matrices as much as possible, e.g. `np.quantile(tB_OLS,[0.05,0.95],axis=0)` returns two quantiles for the whole vector of OLS estimates\n",
    "- When coding, you can reduce the running time by setting `BOOTREP=99` and reduce the number of simulations. For the final execution, please return to original values!\n",
    "- For a progress bar, please install `conda install -c conda-forge tqdm` or if you don't use anaconda use can just execute `pip install tqdm`\n",
    "- If you want to use plotly, please install `conda install -c plotly plotly`\n",
    "- Below, you can find Python code for generating the data and doing a simulation using multicores. To use multicores, you have to install `multiprocess`: `conda install -c conda-forge multiprocess`. Otherwise, execute `pip install multiprocess`\n",
    "- The idea behind multiprocess is that each CPU core receives a sample, executes the resampling and returns the results. These results will be stored in one big list, which can be analyzed after the simulation."
